Fall   Quarter,   2024Homework Assignment #3 - Due: December 5, 2024.   Turn   in   a   writeup   with   your   responses   to   a   ll   questions   below,   codes,   outputs   (e.g.   graphs,   etc.).   Attach   all   your   Python   files   as   well,   so   we      can   run them.
Problem 1: K-means Clustering on a Chemistry Dataset In this   problem, you will   explore   k-means   clustering   on   a   chemical   dataset   using the   scikit-learn   library.   The   dataset   contains   molecular   descriptors   and   water   solubility   values   for   various   compounds.    Your   tasks include   applying   clustering,   interpreting   results,   and   evaluating   the   performance   of your   clustering   model.
Dataset: You will use the delaney solubility with descriptors dataset available through the DeepChem   library.
1. Loading and Exploring the Data 
(a)    Download   and   load   the   dataset   using   DeepChem.    Convert   it   into   a   Pandas   DataFrame   with   feature columns   and   a   target   column   for   solubility   values.    The   following   code   snippet   will   help   you   get   started:import deepchem as dcimport pandas as pd# Load the datasettasks , datasets , transformers = dc . molnet . load_delaney ( featurizer =’ECFP ’,splitter = None )dataset = datasets [0]# Convert to Pandas DataFrame.X = dataset .Xy = dataset .ycolumns = [f’feature_ {i}’ for i in range (X. shape [1]) ]df = pd . DataFrame. (X , columns = columns )df [’solubility ’] = y# Display basic information about the datasetprint ( df . head () )print ( df . describe () )
(b)    Describe   the   data   briefly.       How   many   samples   and   features   are   there?       Are   there   any   missing   values?   If so,   how   would   you   handle   them?
2. Data Preprocessing 
(a)    Standardize   the   features   so   that   they   have   zero   mean   and   unit   variance   using   the   StandardScaler class   from   sklearn.   Explain   why   standardization   is   important   for   k-means   clustering.from sklearn . preprocessing import StandardScaler# Standardize the featuresscaler = StandardScaler ()X_scaled = scaler . fit_transform. ( df . drop (’solubility ’, axis =1) )
3. Applying K-means Clustering 
(a)    Apply   k-means   clustering   to   the   standardized   data   with   k   =   3   clusters.      Use   the   KMeans   class from   sklearn   to   fit   the   model   and   predict   the   cluster   assignments.from sklearn . cluster import KMeans# Apply K- means clusteringk = 3kmeans = KMeans ( n_clusters =k , random_state =42)clusters = kmeans . fit_predict ( X_scaled )df [’cluster ’] = clusters(b)      Reduce   the   dimensionality   of   the   data   to   2   components   using   Principal      Component   Analysis   (PCA) and   plot   the   clusters.   Use   the   PCA   class   from   sklearn.    Hint:       Use   matplotlib   for   plotting.
4. Evaluating Clustering Performance 
(a)      Compute the silhouette score for the clustering using the silhouette score function from sklearn.   What   does   the   silhouette   score   indicate   about   the   quality   of the   clustering?from sklearn . metrics import silhouette_score# Compute silhouette scoresilhouette_avg = silhouette_score ( X_scaled , clusters )print (f" Silhouette Score for k={k}: { silhouette_avg :.3f}")(b)      Experiment   with   different   values   of   k   (e.g.,   k   = 2,   4,   5)   and   compute   the   silhouette   score   for   each value.   Plot   the   silhouette   scores   as   a   function   of   k   to   determine   the   optimal   number   of clusters.
5. Exploring Clustering Interpretability 
(a)      Examine   the   cluster   centroids.    What   patterns,    if   any,   do   you   observe?      Are   there   any   features that   clearly   distinguish   one   cluster   from   another?
(b)    Select   a   few   representative   samples   from   each   cluster   (if   there   are   at   least   three   points   per   cluster)   and   compare   their   solubility   values.    What   can   you   infer   about   the   relationship   between   cluster   membership   and   solubility?   Use   the   following   code   snippet   to   sample   data:# Sampling representative data points from each clusterfor cluster_label in range (k) :cluster_data = df [ df [’cluster ’] == cluster_label ]num_samples = min (3 , len ( cluster_data ))# Ensure we do not samplemore than available data pointssamples = cluster_data . sample ( num_samples , random_state =42)print (f" Cluster { cluster_label } samples :")print ( samples [[ ’solubility ’, ’cluster ’]])
6. Advanced Analysis and Interpretations 
(a)    Compare   the   performance   of   k-means   clustering   with   another   clustering   algorithm,   such   as   Ag-   glomerative   Hierarchical   Clustering   or   DBSCAN, using   the   same   dataset.   Which   method   performs better   based   on   silhouette   scores,   and   why   might   this   be   the   case?   Provide   code   for   your   chosen   alternative   clustering   method   and   a   brief analysis   of your   results.
(b)    K-means   assumes   that   clusters   are   spherical   and   equally   sized.   Discuss   whether   this   assumption   is   reasonable   for the   dataset you   are   using.    Based   on your   understanding   of chemical   descriptors,   do   you   expect   clusters   to   have   such   shapes?   If not,   suggest   preprocessing   or   alternative   methods   that   might   improve   clustering   performance.
(c)      Use   elbow   method   analysis   to   determine   the   optimal   number   of   clusters   for   k-means.    Plot   the sum   of   squared   distances   (inertia) for   a   range   of   cluster   values   (e.g.,   k   =   1   to   k   =   10)   and   identify the   ”elbow   point.”   Explain   your   choice   of the   optimal   k   based   on   this   analysis.# Elbow method plotinertia = []k_range = range (1 , 11)for k in k_range :kmeans = KMeans ( n_clusters =k , random_state =42)kmeans . fit ( X_scaled )inertia . append ( kmeans . inertia_ )import matplotlib . pyplot as pltplt . figure ( figsize =(8 , 5) )plt . plot ( k_range , inertia , marker =’o’)plt . title (’Elbow Method for Optimal k’)plt . xlabel (’Number of Clusters (k)’)plt . ylabel (’Sum of Squared Distances ( Inertia )’)plt . show ()
(d)   Investigate   the   impact   of   feature   selection   on   clustering   performance.   Remove   features   that   have near-zero   variance   or   high   correlation   with   other   features,      and   re-run   the   k-means   clustering.   How   does   feature   selection   impact   the   silhouette   score   and   cluster   interpretability?      Provide   a   brief explanation   supported   by   code   and   results.
(e)      Use   a   dimensionality   reduction   technique   other   than   PCA   (e.g., t-SNE) to   visualize   the   clusters   in a   lower-dimensional   space.   Compare   the   visualization   and   interpretability   of clusters   using   PCA   versus   t-SNE.   Discuss   any   differences   in   the   separation   and   distribution   of   clusters.
Problem 2: Decision Trees and their Application in Chemistry In   this   problem,   you   will   learn   about   decision   trees,   a   type   of   supervised   learning   algorithm   used   for   clas-   sification   and   regression   tasks.   Decision   trees   model   data   by   splitting   it   based   on   feature   values,   creating   a tree-like   structure   of decisions.   You   will   explore   their   application   using   a   chemistry   dataset.
Dataset: You will use the delaney solubility with descriptors dataset available through the DeepChem   library,   which   contains   molecular   descriptors   and   water   solubility   values.
1. Introduction to Decision Trees 
(a)    Read about decision trees:   Decision trees split data into branches based on feature values, creating   a   structure   resembling   a   tree.    At   each   node,   a   decision   is   made   to   split   the   data   further   based   on some   feature   until   a   final   prediction   is   made   at   a   leaf node.   Research   and   briefly   describe:
•    How decision   trees   make   predictions   (e.g.,   how   data   is   split   at   each   node).
•    The advantages   and   disadvantages   of decision   trees   compared   to   other   algorithms.
2. Loading and Exploring the Data 
(a)      Download   and   load   the   delaney solubility with descriptors   dataset   using   the   code   below.
Create   a   Pandas   DataFrame   with   feature   columns   and   a   target   column   for   solubility   values.import deepchem as dcimport pandas as pd# Load the datasettasks , datasets , transformers = dc . molnet . load_delaney ( featurizer =’ECFP ’,splitter =’random ’)train_dataset , valid_dataset , test_dataset = datasets# Convert the training set to a Pandas DataFrame.X_train = train_dataset .Xy_train = train_dataset .ycolumns = [f’feature_ {i}’ for i in range ( X_train . shape [1]) ]df_train = pd . DataFrame. ( X_train , columns = columns )df_train [’solubility ’] = y_train
(b)    Describe   the   dataset:   How   many   features   and   samples   are   present?   What   is   the   target   variable?   Print   the   first   few   rows   to   inspect   the   data.
3. Training a Decision Tree Regressor 
(a)      Use   sklearn’s   DecisionTreeRegressor   to   fit   a   decision   tree   model   to   the   training   data.    Split   the   features   and   target   variable   as   follows:from sklearn . tree import DecisionTreeRegressor# Define features and targetX = df_train . drop (’solubility ’, axis =1)y = df_train [’solubility ’]# Fit the decision tree regressormodel = DecisionTreeRegressor ( random_state =42)model . fit (X , y)
(b)      Examine the structure of the tree using the plot tree function from   sklearn.   Does the tree have   a   large   number   of splits?   What   does   this   imply   about   the   model’s   complexity?from sklearn import treeimport matplotlib . pyplot as pltplt . figure ( figsize =(12 , 8) )tree . plot_tree ( model , max_depth =3 , filled = True , feature_names =X . columns )plt . show ()
4. Evaluating the Model 
(a)      Use   the   trained   model   to   make   predictions   on   the   validation   data.      Compute   the   Mean   Absolute   Error   (MAE)   and   Mean   Squared   Error   (MSE)   as   performance   metrics.from sklearn . metrics import mean_absolute_error , mean_squared_error# Load validation dataX_valid = valid_dataset .Xy_valid = valid_dataset .y# Make predictionsy_pred = model . predict ( X_valid )# Calculate performance metricsmae = mean_absolute_error ( y_valid , y_pred )mse = mean_squared_error ( y_valid , y_pred )print (f" Mean Absolute Error ( MAE): { mae :.3 f}")print (f" Mean Squared Error ( MSE ): { mse :.3 f}")
(b)   Interpret   the   performance   metrics.    Is   the   model   accurate   in   predicting   solubility?    What   do   the   values   of MAE   and   MSE   suggest?
5. Improving the Decision Tree 
(a)      Decision   trees   can   easily   overfit   the   training   data.    Try   limiting   the   maximum   depth   of the   tree   (e.g., max depth=3) and   re-evaluate   the   model   using   MAE   and   MSE.   How   does   limiting   the   depth impact   performance   on   the   validation   data?
(b)      Experiment   with   other   hyperparameters,      such   as   min   samples split   and   min   samples leaf.   How   do   these   parameters   affect   the   model’s   performance   and   complexity?    Provide   a   brief   analysis supported   by   code   and   results.
6. Advanced Analysis (Challenging Question)
(a)      Feature   importance:    Use   the   feature   importances   attribute   of   the   trained   model   to   identify   the   most   important   features   for   predicting   solubility.   Plot   the   feature   importances   and   interpret   the   results.   Do   these   features   make   sense   in   a   chemical   context?import matplotlib . pyplot as pltimport numpy as np# Plot feature importancesimportance = model . feature_importances_feature_names = X. columnsindices = np . argsort ( importance ) [:: -1]plt . figure ( figsize =(10 , 6) )plt . bar ( range ( len ( importance ) ) , importance [ indices ])plt . xticks ( range ( len ( importance )) , feature_names [ indices ], rotation =90)plt . title (’Feature Importances ’)plt . s代 写Chemistry 125-225: Machine Learning in Chemistry Fall Quarter, 2024Python

Problem 4: Understanding and Implementing UMAP UMAP   (Uniform   Manifold   Approximation   and   Projection)   is   a   dimensionality   reduction   technique   that   is   particularly   effective   for   visualizing   high-dimensional   data   in   low-dimensional   spaces.       This   problem   will   guide   you   through   understanding,   implementing,   and   analyzing   UMAP   using   Python.
(a) Introduction to UMAP 
1.   What   is   UMAP?   Research   and   provide   a   brief   explanation   of   what   UMAP   does   and   how   it   works.   Include   a   discussion   of   the   following:
• The   mathematical   foundation   of UMAP   (manifold   learning,   topology,   etc.).
•      The   main   parameters   of   UMAP   (e.g., n neighbors, min dist) and   their   effects   on   the   embedding.
• A   comparison   of UMAP   with   other   dimensionality   reduction   methods   such   as   PCA   and   t-SNE.
2.   Why   is   UMAP   particularly   well-suited   for   visualizing   high-dimensional   datasets?
(b) Dataset Preparation 
Download   a   high-dimensional   dataset   of   your   choice   for   analysis.   For   example:
• MNIST: Handwritten digit images   (available   in   sklearn.datasets).
• ESOL, ChEMBL, or QM9:   Chemical   datasets   containing   molecular   features.
• MOSES:   Molecular   datasets   with   SMILES   strings.
Use   the   following   Python   code   snippet   to   load   the   MNIST   dataset   as   an   example:from sklearn . datasets import fetch_openmlimport pandas as pd# Load MNIST datasetmnist = fetch_openml (’mnist_784 ’, version =1)X = mnist . datay = mnist . targetprint (f" Shape of data : {X. shape }, Shape of labels : {y. shape }")
Answer   the   following   questions:
1.   What   is   the   dimensionality   of   the   dataset?
2.    How   would   you   preprocess   this   dataset   for   UMAP?   Perform   any   necessary   preprocessing   steps,   such   as   scaling   or   normalization,   and   provide   the   Python   code.
(c) Implementing UMAP 
Use   the   umap-learn   Python   library   to   reduce   the   dimensionality   of your   dataset   to   2   dimensions   for   visu-   alization.   Here   is   a   code   snippet   to   get   started:import umap . umap_ as umapimport matplotlib . pyplot as plt# Initialize and fit UMAPreducer = umap . UMAP ( n_neighbors =15 , min_dist =0.1 , random_state =42)X_embedded = reducer . fit_transform.

Questions:
1.   What   do   the   parameters   n neighbors   and   min dist   control   in   the   UMAP   algorithm?      Experiment   with   different   values   for   these   parameters   and   describe   their   effects   on   the   embedding.
2.      How   does   the   UMAP   embedding   compare   with   the   original   high-dimensional   data?
(d) Analyzing UMAP Results 
After   generating   the   2D   embedding,   analyze   the   results:
1.   Identify   any   clusters   in   the   2D   projection.   Do   these   clusters   correspond   to   meaningful   patterns   in   the   original   data   (e.g.,   digit   classes   in   MNIST   or   chemical   properties   in   molecular   datasets)?
2.    Compute   the   pairwise   distances   between   points   in   the   original   high-dimensional   space   and   compare them with distances in the 2D   embedding.   What   can   you   infer   about   UMAP’s   ability   to   preserve   local   versus   global   structures?
3.      For   chemical   datasets,   relate   the   UMAP   clusters   to   specific   molecular   properties   such   as   polarity   or molecular   weight.   Are   there   clear   separations   between   different   types   of   molecules?
(e) Comparison with PCA and t-SNE 
Perform   dimensionality   reduction   on   the   same   dataset   using   PCA   and   t-SNE   for   comparison.       Use    the   following   code   snippets:from sklearn . decomposition import PCAfrom sklearn . manifold import TSNE# PCApca = PCA ( n_components =2)X_pca = pca . fit_transform. (X)# t- SNEtsne = TSNE ( n_components =2 , random_state =42)X_tsne = tsne . fit_transform. ( X)# Plot PCAplt . figure ( figsize =(8 , 6) )plt . scatter ( X_pca [: , 0] , X_pca [: , 1] , c=y , cmap =’Spectral ’, s =5)plt . colorbar ( label =" Digit Label ")plt . title ("PCA Projection of MNIST Dataset ")plt . xlabel (" PCA Dimension 1")plt . ylabel (" PCA Dimension 2")plt . show ()# Plot t- SNEplt . figure ( figsize =(8 , 6) )plt . scatter ( X_tsne [: , 0] , X_tsne [: , 1] , c=y , cmap =’Spectral ’, s =5)plt . colorbar ( label =" Digit Label ")plt . title ("t- SNE Projection of MNIST Dataset ")plt . xlabel ("t- SNE Dimension 1")plt . ylabel ("t- SNE Dimension 2")plt . show ()
Questions:
1.      How   do   the   embeddings   generated   by   PCA,   t-SNE,   and   UMAP   differ   in   terms   of   cluster   separation   and   overall   structure?
2.   Which   method   appears   to   work   best   for   this   dataset,   and   why?      Consider   factors   such   as   local   and global   structure   preservation,   computational   efficiency,   and   interpretability.
3.      Reflect   on   the   strengths   and   limitations   of UMAP   compared   to   PCA   and   t-SNE.
(f) Applications of UMAP in Chemistry 
Provide   examples   of   how   UMAP   can   be   applied   to   chemical   datasets.   Possible   applications   include:
1.   Visualizing   chemical   space   to   identify   clusters   of   similar   molecules.
2.      Analyzing   high-dimensional   molecular   features   for   drug   discovery.
3.    Reducing   the   dimensionality   of   quantum   chemical   datasets   for   machine   learning   models.
Discuss   how   UMAP’s   ability   to   preserve   local   structure   can   be   beneficial   in   each   of   these   scenarios. Submission: Submit   a   report   containing:
• Python   code   for   each   part   of the   problem.
